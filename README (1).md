# Heart Disease Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient.

# Data Sourcing
The dataset used for this project was gotten from Kaggle.

# Data transformation
- The dataset did not have null values.
- I had to group the age column into age brackets to enable me visualize better.

# Conclusion
I was able to build a model that can predict patients with heart disease using various algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbor** and **Random Forest** with Logistic Regression giving an accuracy of approximately 87%.

I intend optimizing my model and also use other evaluation metrics to evalaute my model.
